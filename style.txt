Python Coding Style Convention

Please read the Google Coding Style Conventions:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

The following are the most important ones to follow:

1. Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines. Example:

class FirstClass:
    pass


class SecondClass:
    pass


def top_level_function():
    return None

2. Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line. Example:

class ClassWithMethods:
    def first_method(self):
        return None

    def second_method(self):
        return None

3. Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps. Example:

def calculate_variance(numbers):
    sum_numbers = 0
    for number in numbers:
        sum_numbers = sum_numbers + number
    mean = sum_numbers / len(numbers)

    sum_squares = 0
    for number in numbers:
        sum_squares = sum_squares + number**2
    mean_squares = sum_squares / len(numbers)

    return mean_squares - mean**2

4. Limit number of characters of each line to 79.

5. Indentation should be 4 white spaces.

6. Never use tab.

7. Naming styles
7.1 Function: Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores.
7.2 Variable: Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores.
7.3 Class: Start each word with a capital letter. Don’t separate words with underscores, instead use CamelCase.
7.4 Method: Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores.
7.5 Constant: Use an uppercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores.
7.6 Module: Use a short, lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores.
7.7 Package: Use a short, lowercase word or words. Don’t separate words with underscores.
